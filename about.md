# About Us

MOMesh is a community operated WISP (wireless internet service provider), focused on connecting underserved communities, committed to transparency and open source.

We are a diverse group of volunteers dedicated to ending the digital divide and extending high-speed, reliable internet to everyone. You can help by joining our community network to get online, volunteering to connect neighbors or grow the network, and donating to improve our community infrastructure and ensure access for all.

By joining our network, you agree to extend access to others. Growing the mesh helps the entire community enjoy faster and more reliable internet. MOMesh is a neutral network and we do not monitor, collect, store or block any user data or content.
