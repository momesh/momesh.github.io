MOMesh is building a community owned and operated wireless network and WISP in Missouri, focused on connecting underserved communities.

## Join our community network!

- Volunteer to help build our network
- Donate to help us expand

We are just getting started, and are currently building our core infrastructure. If you are interested in helping us get started, [let us know](google form here)!

We can connect your apartment to the internet by putting an antenna on the roof of your building and running a cable to your apartment.

We can also connect your whole building using fiber with speeds of 10 gigabit or more. Ask us about fiber to the home (FTTH). We are currently working with NYCHA and HPD on multiple large projects.
