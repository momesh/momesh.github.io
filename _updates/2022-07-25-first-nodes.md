Our first 3 nodes are online and broadcasting!

We have setup the `-MOMesh Community WiFi-` Wi-Fi network to provide Pinnacle Lake's public beach, boat parking, and picnic area with public access internet, so you can stay connected even if you are nowhere near your home router. Help us to extend the coverage of our mesh network to more of our community, by [joining today](/join)!

Interest in the project is brewing, and we have handful of new potential nodes on our [map](/map), as well as a few nodes in the planning phases.
