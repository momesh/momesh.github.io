## About MOMesh

### <a name="why"></a>Why is MOMesh building a community network?

Below are just a few of the reasons to join and support MOMesh:

-   We are building an infrastructure commons that is accessible to everyone
-   We are a neutral network that does not block or discriminate content or throttle data  
-   We do not collect personal data  
-   We’re committed to bridging the Digital Divide by connecting underserved communities in Missouri
-   We are building a resilient emergency community network
-   We are decentralized, with no single point of failure as an organization or network  
-   We believe in building community and supporting highly localized websites and services  
-   We offer public wi-fi hotspots across the network 
-   We allow for fast uploads as well as downloads


### <a name="how"></a>How does it work?

Most MOMesh community members (“nodes”) have wireless routers mounted on a rooftop or balcony to connect to other nodes, forming a network. You can see examples of the outdoor routers we use [here](/equipment).

Our network peers (connects) with many other networks at an [Internet exchange point (IXP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point), providing direct access to the Internet without the intermediary of a commercial Internet Service Provider. MOMesh maintains a number of primary Internet exchange points that we call “Supernodes.”


### <a name="security"></a>Is the Mesh secure?

By default, our mesh router is firewalled from your local network. It is not possible to reach beyond the mesh router to your local access network (LAN).

The mesh internet connection to your dwelling is secure using standard WPA2 encryption. Traffic between nodes on the mesh is also encrypted using WPA2. We also support VPN connections for an additional layer of security.

When connecting through the mesh from the street (i.e. with `-MOMesh Community Internet-` SSID) you should use the same standard precautions as you would when connecting to WiFi at a coffee shop or airport: use [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (lock icon) web sites for secure connections (most browsers do this by default nowadays), or use a VPN service.

### <a name="data"></a>What is your user data policy?

See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).


## Joining the Community

### <a name="signup"></a>How do I sign up?

After reading through the FAQs, fill out the [join form](/join). If you would like to volunteer with MOMesh, please mention so!


### <a name="cost"></a>Is there a cost to join?

MOMesh believes that the Internet is for everyone. By operating as a volunteer run organization, we keep costs as low as possible.

- Average equipment cost: **~$240** (see [equipment](/equipment) for details)
- Average installation costs: **$50** (including mounting gear, hardware, cable, etc: [DIY](/diy))

Once connected, if you can afford it, we also recommend that you set up a recurring monthly donation of $20, $30, $50, or even $60. We rely on these donations to maintain and expand our network. We are all volunteers to 100% of these contributions go to building and maintaining the network.

If the above suggested donations are too much for you to afford, we can get you connected all the same, just reach out! Internet is a human right.

### <a name="free"></a>I heard that MOMesh was free Internet. Is that true?

We believe EVERYONE should be able to connect online. That said, the [wireless equipment](/equipment) we use to connect you and your neighbors does cost money. We ask those who can afford it to donate a reasonable amount monthly, or to volunteer by helping connect your neighbors, or both!

### <a name="obligations"></a>What are my obligations as a MOMesh community member?

By joining the Mesh you are obliged to share and extend the Mesh in the same way that it was shared with you (details: [Network Commons License](./network-commons-license)).

At a minimum, this requires providing power to your rooftop router so that other members can connect to it. (It uses less power in a whole day than it takes to lightly toast a slice of bread). We may also request access to your rooftop after the initial installation in order to upgrade the rooftop router infrastructure. You are not obligated to pay a monthly fee although we suggest a recurring donation if you can afford it to help keep the network running and growing.

### <a name="volunteer"></a>How can I volunteer? What if I don't know anything about networking?

If you are a DIY-er, take a peek at [DIY installs](/diy).
