Used as a router, access point, PoE distribution hub. Typically this device is the brains of each small to medium sized node and hub. It accepts 28v PoE on ether1, and can passthrough the same voltage to ether2-5. We use this to provide the 24v required by Ubiquiti gear attached to the Omnitik, in order to simplify power distribution for complicated hub configurations.
