# DIY Installation

We heartily encourage you to join the mesh network by building your own [node](./nodes) or [hub](./hubs), using our do-it-yourself guides.

## Checklist

This is our recommended way to build your own node and join the mesh.

1. [Fill out the join form](/join)
  - This lets us know you are interested in joining
2. [Read the FAQ](/faq)
  - This should give you a good overview of how MOMesh works
3. Next, cozy up and read about how [nodes](./nodes) and [hubs](./hubs) work
  - [Equipment List](/equipment)
4. Find line-of-sight to your nearest node or hub
  - We like using our [map](/map) and binoculars to help identify how you can connect to nearby nodes
  - Look for SSIDs like `momesh-XYZ-omni`, where `XYZ` is the node number
  - Use site survey function on Airmax capable radios to help locate other nodes
5. Walk your property and conduct a site-survey for your node's physical location
  - The more visible your node is to others, the better (elevation, clear line of sight)
  - Wifi signals can be disrupted by branches and leaves, so unobstructed line-of-sight to your neighboring nodes are best!
  - Rooftop routers are powered via Power over Ethernet. Plan for an outdoor ethernet run from a protected AC outlet to the mounting location
6. Get a Network Number
  - MOMesh will allocate you a Network Number to identify your node on the mesh
  - A Network Number will be required to configure your radios correctly
7. Purchase your hardware
  - What radios you need depends on which radios your neighbors have
  - The [Equipment List](/equipment) for each device has a recommended purchase link, to help you buy the correct hardware version
8. Configure your radios
  - Configuration for Ubiquiti devices can be performed from a mobile device
  - Omnitiks require more complicated configuration (TODO: link to configuration generator)
9. Physically assemble your node
  - This is where you would need to crimp some outdoor ethernet cables to connect your radios together
  - Sturdily mount radios on a J-pipe with band clamps or similar
  - Pay attention to ensuring drip loops are present to prevent water ingress into radios
10. Align and tune
  - Perform alignment of any PTP radios, balance chains, optimize spectral use and TX power limits
11. Connect to the mesh
  - If all goes well, your node should be online
  - A public access `-MOMesh Community WiFi-` SSID should be available for visitors
  - You can run ethernet from the rooftop node into your dwelling, and connect to your home router's WAN port
12. [Set up a monthly donation](/donate)!
  - Your generous donations allow us continue building our community owned network to connect everyone!
